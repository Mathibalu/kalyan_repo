<h3><u>About:</h3></u>
<p>Konidela Pawan Kalyan (born Konidela Kalyan Babu; 2 September 1968 or 1971[n 1]) is an Indian actor, politician, filmmaker, martial artist, and philanthropist who primarily works in Telugu cinema. Known for his unique acting style and mannerisms, he has a large fan base and a cult following. One of the highest-paid actors of Indian cinema, he has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2013 and is the recipient of a Filmfare Award, a SIIMA Award, a CineMAA Award, and a Santosham Film Award.[5] He is also the founder of the Jana Sena Party.
<h3><u>Political Career</h3></u>
<p>Kalyan started his political career in 2008[51] as the president of Yuvarajyam,[52] the youth wing of Praja Rajyam Party which was started by his elder brother Chiranjeevi. He neither contested in elections nor did he hold any constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While he actively campaigned for the party, he was also hit with few health problems. Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by a sunstroke during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009.[53] Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his party[54] with Congress,[55] Kalyan took a break from political life, expressing his silent discontent with his brother's decision to merge the party,[56] and started a new political party in 2014 called Jana Sena Party
<h3><u>Jana Sena Party</h3></u>
<p>Kalyan founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March 2014.[57] He wrote a book titled Ism which is also the ideology of the Jana Sena party.[58] He met with then BJP Prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and extended his support.[59] He campaigned extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He opposed Congress party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the Country' in Hindi).[60] His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[61] In August 2017, he announced that he intended to enter full-time politics starting October 2017 once he completes his film commitments
